# Cherry Tree Homework Problem
For this problem you will initialize an Emberjs project, and create a simple homepage. The homepage should display a counter and a button. Each time the button is clicked, the counter should increment by 1. 

## (Optional) Color changing and tests
If you choose to do so, you may modify the behavior so that the color of the counter changes to red when displaying an odd number. Please write a rendering test to test the new functionality.
